/**
 * Speech marks → a highlight model anchored on character offsets.
 *
 * Measured against the live API 2026-09-04 (simba-3.2 / harper_32), and the
 * whole reader rests on what that probe found:
 *
 *  - Every mark carries `start` and `end`, character offsets into the exact
 *    `input` string that was sent, and `input.slice(start, end) === value`
 *    held for every mark in every case tried.
 *  - Marks do NOT correspond one-to-one with whitespace tokens. The API
 *    merges ("Dr. Smith" and "item #3" each came back as ONE mark) and
 *    splits ('"this' came back as '"' then 'this').
 *  - Marks can DROP text entirely: in `(a Thursday)` the "(" and "Thursday"
 *    got no mark at all, an 8-character hole in an otherwise covered string.
 *  - The top-level "sentence" node is not a sentence. A three-sentence
 *    paragraph came back as a single sentence chunk holding every word.
 *
 * So: never index marks by token position, never trust the sentence layer.
 * Offsets are the anchor, and `fillGaps` closes the holes so the highlight
 * can never land on nothing while audio is playing.

 * and the direction matters. A dropped word is still spoken, and the audio for
 * it lands inside the next mark's time window, not the previous one's. In the
 * live "(a Thursday)" case the mark for ")" held 682ms, far too long for a
 * bracket and about right for "Thursday)". Absorbing backward would extend the
 * "a" mark's offsets while leaving its 171ms window untouched, so at the moment
 * "Thursday" is spoken the playhead would still land on ")" and highlight one
 * character. Absorbing forward puts the words and the time in the same mark.

 * The first mark is pulled back to 0 and the last pushed out to the end of the
